# How to Install Global Packages

There are two ways to install npm packages: locally or globally. You choose which kind of installation to use based on how you want to use the package.

* If you want to use the package as a command line tool, something like the grunt CLI, then you want to install it globally. This way, it works no matter which directory is your current directory. 

* If you want to depend on the package from your own module using something like Node's `require`, then you want to install [locally](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-npm-packages-locally).

To download packages globally, you simply use the command `npm install -g <package>`, e.g.:

```
npm install -g jshint
```

If you get an EACCES error, [see Chapter 3](/getting-started/fixing-npm-permissions). 

*Tip: Consider using npx to run packages globally, if you have npm 5.2 or greater installed.*
